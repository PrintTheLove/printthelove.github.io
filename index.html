        <h1>Print the Love: Serving the World with Polaroid Pictures</h1>
        <p>Print the Love is about more than just giving away a photograph to those who have none. It is about hope, love, and encouragement. It is about uplifting others, helping them see the beauty in themselves regardless of their circumstance.</p>

          <h5>Children<span>Served</span></h5>
          <p>Children in many under-resourced communities are marginalized and often not celebrated for who they are. We want to change that! Self-worth is important for emotional and social development. Very few children get school photos taken or have any record of their childhood. In addition, if a child were to be lost or taken, there would be a photograph to help find him or her.</p>

          <p>New mothers in maternity wards around the globe rarely have access to photographs of their newborns and this lifechanging event. Others who are losing a loved one would like to cherish the last moments they have together. Even those in the hospital for more minor issues feel the value of the gift as a break in the day with warmth of the a smile. All feel encouraged that they are not forgotten in a difficult time.</p>

      <h2>Sustainability</h2>
      <p>As Print the Love looks to the future, we believe Print the Love can stand on its own as a cause to be supported. But we clearly see that the partnership possiblities are endless with humanitarian efforts around the world. From US based organizations to local agencies on the ground in each county, partnership and need are ever-present. With strategic partnerships like the one we have with the <a href="http://polaroid.com" target="_blank">Polaroid Corporation</a>, we are excited to see the impact Print the Love can make. </p><i class="fa fa-4x fa-arrow-down c-next"></i>

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>As a <a href="http://kosmeoconsulting.com" target="_blank">nonprofit consultant</a>, in the summer of 2013, Ceallaigh Anderson had the privilege of traveling to Rwanda with a leadership speaking team. </p>
        <p>While there she was able to travel to small towns and villages, schools, hospitals, churches, a prison, and engage with the rich and the poor, from politicians to the homeless. And one thing was true across the board. Everyone loved to have their picture taken. But of course it was the eagerness of the children that had the most impact on her. As soon as she took a picture, each child always wanted to look at the back of her digital camera to see themselves or their family and friends. She desperately wanted to be able to print one out and give it to them! </p>
        <p>Thus Print the Love was born! Polaroid pictures always spread so much love and many smiles. She vowed to be back the following year, ready to print the love!</p>

      <section><strong>10 Days in the Land of 1000 Hills.<br>1 Encouraging Photographer.<br>1000 Photo Gifts.<br>Life Long Treasures of Love.</strong>
        <p>Ceallaigh travelled back to Rwanda the following year in 2014, during the 20th anniversary of the genocide with camera in tow as she had promised to herself. She raised funds through crowdfunding and brought two Polaroid cameras (Z340 and Z2300) and film. She was able to give away 1,000 Polaroid picture gifts to people who most likely have never had a printed photo of themselves - a treasure that they will likely keep for the rest of their lives. It was a simple small gift to say "You matter!" to each person, child, new mother, or family she encountered. The reactions of the people were profound! The project was a complete success!</p>
        <h3>The Vision Expands</h3>
        <p>What an amazing gift Ceallaigh recieved when she was able to witness her vision come alive through the smiles and joy of the Rwandan people as she handed out Polaroid pictures. Many people came forward, even strangers, to support the project with their donations. She wanted to see the vision and passion continue beyond Rwanda. So she assembled a team of people (including our friends at the <a href="http://polaroid.com" target="_blank">Polaroid Corporation</a>) around her who were passionate about growing an organization to enable many more people worldwide to feel the infectious joy of giving and recieving Love Polaroid pictures. Together, we can make great things happen!</p>

      <h2>A Gift</h2>
      <p>A gift so personal is seldom given in humanitarian efforts. We all know how much we love to take and get photos of our families, children, and friends. Even in this digital age in the U.S. where we have access to images anytime, we appreciate and cherish the photographs we get to hold in our hands. Imagine what it would be like to get a picture if you had very few or none. The influence on each person and their families is significant.</p><i class="fa fa-4x fa-arrow-down c-next"></i>

      <h3>Working together we can do more</h3>
      <div class="c-columns">
        <p>Print the Love brought encouragement and love to all the people Ceallaigh came across. We would love to extend this across the globe with your help! We recognize the great needs for water, food, health, and shelter that exists for many developing countries today. But we believe that we are called to take care of our global brothers and sisters in other ways and that all of us humans, regardless of our circumstance, need love and encouragement, to feel valued and celebrated by our families, communities, and even by strangers. What better way to do this than the gift of a Polaroid picture?</p>
        <p>We hope you will examine this following partnership plan with great consideration. Your donation dollar would go extremely far. With no administration cost at all, as we are all volunteers, Print the Love is able to put all support right into the action of giving away Polaroid pictures to people across the globe. We also believe this can be the start of a great collaboration for years to come.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>The Need</h3>
      <p>Our greatest need is resources - funding for travel costs and Polaroid equipment (at a very reduced rate from our friends at the <a href="http://polaroid.com" target="_blank">Polaroid Corporation</a>). To stay in line with our mission to celebrate all people groups and serve those in under-resourced communities, we strategically chose travel locations in 3 different continents - South America, Asia, and Africa. All are on the list of least developed and most impoverished in the world. Strategically we will travel to remote areas where electricity and especially photographs are scarce.</p><i class="fa fa-4x fa-arrow-down c-next"></i>
